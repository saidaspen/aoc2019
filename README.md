# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions in Java
Here are my attempts at solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in Java. 
I write Java code daily and have been for the last 15 years or so, so one would think I would be able to handle it. We will see.

My solutions in rust is available here [Advent of Code 2019 Solutions in Rust](https://github.com/saidaspen/aoc2019_rust).

To run a solution. 
First build it using ```make```. This will compile the java classes into ```dist/``` directory.
```
$ make
```

From there, either run it yourself or use the shell-script provided. Here is an example running the puzzle or day 1 (Aoc01)
with the inputs taken from file ```/User/saidaspen/aoc2019/inputs/aoc01.txt```

```
$ dist/aoc.sh Aoc01 /User/saidaspen/aoc2019/inputs/aoc01.txt
```
